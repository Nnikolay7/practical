You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I′m popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pom-pom
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
′Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song
